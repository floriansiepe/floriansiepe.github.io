privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability

possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.</p>
<p>Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
each party's liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted
by law.</p>
<h2 id="as-is-and-as-available-disclaimer">&quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; Disclaimer</h2>
<p>The Service is provided to You &quot;AS IS&quot; and &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot; and with
all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors
and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,

particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may
arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that
the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results,
be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or
services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or

company's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the

servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company
are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs
or other harmful components.</p>
<p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of
warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
applicable law.</p>
<h2 id="governing-law">Governing Law</h2>

<h3 id="severability">Severability</h3>

objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
and effect.</p>
<h3 id="waiver">Waiver</h3>
<p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not effect a
party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a
waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
<h2 id="translation-interpretation">Translation Interpretation</h2>
<p>These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them
