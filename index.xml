&lt;h2 id=&#34;limitation-of-liability&#34;&gt;Limitation of Liability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notwithstanding any damages that You might incur, the entire liability
of the Company and any of its suppliers under any provision of this
Terms and Your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be
limited to the amount actually paid by You through the Service or 100

privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability
to use the Service, third-party software and/or third-party hardware
used with the Service, or otherwise in connection with any provision of
this Terms), even if the Company or any supplier has been advised of the
possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its
essential purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or
limitation of liability for incidental or consequential damages, which
means that some of the above limitations may not apply. In these states,
each party&#39;s liability will be limited to the greatest extent permitted
by law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;as-is-and-as-available-disclaimer&#34;&gt;&amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;AS AVAILABLE&amp;quot; Disclaimer&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Service is provided to You &amp;quot;AS IS&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;AS AVAILABLE&amp;quot; and with
all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum
extent permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf
and on behalf of its Affiliates and its and their respective licensors
and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether
express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Service,
including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a
particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may
arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade
practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company provides no
warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that
the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any intended results,
be compatible or work with any other software, applications, systems or
services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or
reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can
or will be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the
company&#39;s provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind,
express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the

thereon; (ii) that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free;

or other harmful components.&lt;/p&gt;

warranties or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer,
so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to
You. But in such a case the exclusions and limitations set forth in this
section shall be applied to the greatest extent enforceable under
applicable law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;governing-law&#34;&gt;Governing Law&lt;/h2&gt;

mandatory provisions of the law of the country in which you are resident

such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the
objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under
applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force
and effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;waiver&#34;&gt;Waiver&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require
performance of an obligation under this Terms shall not effect a
party&#39;s ability to exercise such right or require such performance at
any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a
waiver of any subsequent breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;translation-interpretation&#34;&gt;Translation Interpretation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Terms and Conditions may have been translated if We have made them
