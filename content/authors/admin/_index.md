I am a software developer somewhere in the nowhere of North Hessia. My interests include software development in all kinds of forms. In particular the Java ecosystem, cloud-native business apps as well as modern web applications.

My primary technologies include both the Java and the Javascript world. Frameworks like [Angular](https://angular.io), [Spring Boot](https://spring.io) or [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) are my primary toolsets.
