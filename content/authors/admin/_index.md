I am a software developer somewhere in the nowhere of North Hessia. My interests include software development in all kinds of forms. In particular, the fields of Big Data and Full-Stack development are my home.

My primary technologies include both the Python, Java and the Javascript world. Frameworks like [Sklearn](https://scikit-learn.org), [Scipy](https://scipy.org) or [Angular](https://angular.io) and [Quarkus](https://quarkus.io) are my primary toolsets.
